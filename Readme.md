# **Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo for Drug and Malady Classification**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to classify drugs into specific medical maladies. By training the model with a domain-specific dataset, it achieves greater accuracy and relevance for use in healthcare-related applications. The goal is to automate the process of drug classification and improve decision-making efficiency.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Montegan/drug_fintuned
cd drug_fintuned
```
````

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### **4. Ensure Single Script**

This project is self-contained in a single Python script. Ensure that all logic for fine-tuning, testing, and running the interactive interface is in `main.py`.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **1. Run the Script**

Simply execute the script to perform all tasks:

```bash
python main.py
```

### **2. Features Included in the Script**

- **Fine-Tuning**: The script uploads the dataset, creates a fine-tuning job, and monitors its status.
- **Testing**: Tests the fine-tuned model with predefined inputs to validate its performance.
- **Interactive Interface**: Launches a Gradio-based web app where users can input drug names and get their classification.

## **View the Detailed Implementation**

For a step-by-step explanation of the fine-tuning process, testing logic, and interactive demo, refer to the [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14pGa3vzO6w2SvJkJ9FKEojE4KF2Zzp2mxyxUUBobIJU/edit?usp=sharing](#).

## **Conclusion**

This project showcases the power of fine-tuning language models for domain-specific applications. By leveraging GPT-3.5 Turbo, we successfully automated the classification of drugs into maladies, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. Future expansions of this project could include extending the dataset, fine-tuning for additional healthcare domains, and integrating the model into real-world medical systems.
